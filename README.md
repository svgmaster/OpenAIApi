# OpenAI API Library for C++

This is Community-maintained OpenAI API Library for modern C++, provides access to the OpenAI API to implementing in C++ applications. The some part of the code in this library follow [OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/openai/openai-openapi) and was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech)

## Dependencies

Build tools and Libraries:

- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)
- [Visual Studio Community 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) ( for Windows Only )
- [vcpkg](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg)
- [Libcurl](https://curl.se/download.html)
- [nlohmann/json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) ( JSON libraries, integrated in project )

## Installations

### Library installation on Linux:

You can compile and install the library with these commands:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/svgmaster/OpenAIApi
$ cd OpenAIApi/build
$ cmake ..
$ make -j4
$ sudo make install
```

### Library installation on MacOS

You can install dependencies with these commands:

```brew
brew install gcc cmake openssl curl
```

You can compile and install the library, same like Linux instructions.

### Library installation on Windows

Build on Windows with Visual Studio (VS2022)

Prerequisites:

```cmd
vcpkg install curl:x64-windows
```
- Open folder containing source code
- Select 'OpenAIApi.sln' solution file
- Once visual studio opens.
- Select Build > Build Solution.


## Usage

To use the library needs to be configured with your account's secret key, which is available on the official OpenAI [website](https://beta.openai.com/account/api-keys). We recommend setting it as an environment variable. Here's an example of initializing the library with the API key and Organization Key loaded from an environment variable and creating a completion:

**Important note: Don't expose your secret API key. [See here](https://beta.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication) for more details.**

When build your solution for Windows don't forget to add this library "Ws2_32.lib" "Wldap32.lib" "Crypt32.lib" to linker [See here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4176503/unresolved-symbols-when-linking-a-program-using-libcurl) for details.

```cpp
#include <iostream>

#include <OpenAIApi/Client.h>
using namespace OpenAIApi;

int main()
{ 
    /* get API key for authentication */
    std::string apiKey = getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY");
    
    /* optional specify which organization is used for an API request */
    std::string orgId = getenv("OPENAI_ORG_ID"); 
	
    Client client = Client( apiKey, orgId );
    
    std::string response = client.createCompletion({
        {"model", "text-davinci-002"},
        {"prompt" , "Say this is an example"},
        {"temperature", 0},
        {"max_tokens", 10}
        })
        ["choices"][0]["text"];	
		
	std::cout << response << std::endl;
	
	return 0;
}        
```

## Error handling

In situation API requests can return errors due to invalid inputs or other issues. These errors can be handled with a `try...catch` statement:

```cpp
try 
{
    Client* client = new Client( "OPENAI_API_KEY" );
    
    std::string response = client->createCompletion({
        {"model", "text-davinci-008"}, // throw error: this model does not exists
        {"prompt" , "Say this is an example"},
        })
        ["choices"][0]["text"];
		
	delete client; // always free up memory :)	
		
	std::cout << response << std::endl;
}
catch ( OpenAIException error )
{
    std::cout << error.getMessage() << std::endl;
}
```
